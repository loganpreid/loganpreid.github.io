title: "Custom Polaris Pro-R Chassis — SolidWorks Assembly"
description: |
  This project involved developing a SolidWorks assembly of a custom Polaris Pro-R tube chassis, created to support laser-cut tube and sheet-metal manufacturing for a future vehicle iteration. The model captures most of the chassis geometry using complex 3D sketch-driven members and robust mating strategies to ensure dimensional accuracy and manufacturability. The project is currently unfinished as we transition to a 3D-scanner-based design method to ensure accuracy with the OEM structure on which the custom chassis is built.

  Significant emphasis was placed on modeling complex multi-tube joints and defining clear design intent for fabrication. Joint geometry was developed with the welding sequence in mind, allowing the chassis to be assembled in a controlled order. Tubular geometry was normalized for laser cutting using a SolidWorks surface-based workflow adapted from industry research, enabling accurate flat-pattern generation and downstream DFM optimization.

  Through this project, I strengthened my skills in advanced assemblies, reverse engineering, and CAD-to-manufacturing workflows.
