title: "Custom Pro-R Chassis (In Progress)"
description: |
  I created a SolidWorks assembly based on a custom Polaris Pro-R tube chassis that my friend is building with the intent 
  of getting all tubes and sheet metal parts laser cut for the next iteration of the car. Each of the tube ends must be normalized
  so that they can be laser cut.
skills: 
- SolidWorks
- Reverse engineering
- DFM
