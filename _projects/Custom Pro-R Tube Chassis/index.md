title: "Custom Polaris Pro-R Chassis — SolidWorks Assembly"
description: |
  This project involved developing a full SolidWorks assembly of a custom Polaris Pro-R tube chassis, created to support laser-cut tube and sheet-metal manufacturing for a future vehicle iteration. The model captures the complete chassis geometry using complex 3D sketch-driven members and robust mating strategies to ensure dimensional accuracy and manufacturability.

  Significant emphasis was placed on modeling complex multi-tube joints and defining clear design intent for fabrication. Joint geometry was developed with weld accessibility, load paths, and welding sequence in mind, allowing the chassis to be assembled in a controlled order while minimizing distortion. Tubular geometry was normalized for laser cutting using a SolidWorks surface-based workflow adapted and refined from industry research, enabling accurate flat-pattern generation and downstream DFM optimization.

  Through this project, I strengthened my skills in advanced assemblies, reverse engineering, and CAD-to-manufacturing workflows.
